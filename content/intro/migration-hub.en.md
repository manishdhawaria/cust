#### AWS Migration Hub

<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/" target="_blank">AWS Migration Hub</a> provides a single location to track the progress of application migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions.

To enable it, inside **AWS Console** go to **Services -> AWS Migration Hub**, then from the left menu click on **Migrate** and select **US West Oregon** as your home region.

Then click on **Migrate -> Tools** to select tools that will provide updates to **AWS Migration Hub**. CloudEndure Migration is already working out of the box, but you need to configure integration with **AWS Database Migration Service**.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the **Connect** button in the **AWS Database Migration Service card**.

In a matter of seconds, the status of integration should change from **Not connected**, to **Connected**.

That's it, all your future activities in **CloudEndure Migration** and **AWS Database Migration Service** will be reported through the **AWS Migration Hub** dashboard.
