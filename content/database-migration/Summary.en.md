Congratulations, you have successfully:

1. Created a new managed database, using **Amazon Relational Database Service**
2. Created an **AWS Database Migration Service replication instance** - that allows you to replicate data between databases
3. Created the **source and target database endpoints**
4. Modified the configuration of the source database to allow for **continuous replication of data**
5. Started the replication of data through a **replication task**

So now it's time to migrate and configure the webserver!
